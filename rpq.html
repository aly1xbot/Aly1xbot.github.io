                                <p><b>Abstract:</b>In the recent years, the focus on epigenetic inheritance phenomenon is being more discussed by researchers from different areas. The special property of the Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance involves behavioral alteration for mammal without the true alteration in genetic content but only alteration of genetic content's expression pattern. This phenomenon could be induced by multiple environmental factor which includes heat stress, social stress and nutritional related stress. In this literature review article, the nutritional induced transgenerational epigenetic inheritance will be mainly focused and discussed including the discussion of detailed mechanism that cause it, the comparison of experiment data from different studies and also the detailed behavioral change for each kinds of nutritional factor. Also, the opinion about this area of research will also be included in this paper. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>Introduction:</b>The recent increasing focusing on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) leads to more and more researchers to investigate about this phenomenon which deviates from the general Darwinian definition of inheritance which only the change in genetic content would alter the animals’ behavior. However, the deviation of TEI from the general inheritance mechanism begins with the definition of Epigenetic which specified by Waddington et al as the way which external factor could directly act on the genetic expression by only altering the expression pattern of gene instead of directly regulate the genetic content (Waddington, 2011). Furthermore, the TEI is more strictly defined by Skinner et al. which includes two criteria which first is generation F0 expose to certain events and the second would be these should presence the effect of event on the body of F2 and F3 generations which depends on whether the mother or father is being effect in the F0 generation (Lacal & Ventura, 2018). Thus, differentiate from the common mutation induced evolution or behavioral change, TEI induced behavioral change may only last for a few generations and then lose, if the offspring wants to regain this advantageous trait, they need to be exposed to environmental stress again which cannot last for long (Moore et al., 2019). Therefore, TEI effect on animals is especially worth to study and the variety in this research field leads more and more researchers to dive into it and tries to make a more holistic comprehension about the detailed mechanism for each kind of behavioral changes. Many animals have observed to have TEI effect on their behavioral change under the environmental stresses including C. elegans, mice, dogs, pigs and human which each kind of animals respond to environmental stress differently due to the difference in their body structure and mechanism (Otterdijk & Michels, 2016). Range from the variety of animals, TEI generally take three pathway to function on the animals which are the DNA methylation, histone modification and small RNA differential expression (Zhang & Tian, 2021). Also, except for these most general three mechanisms other mechanisms like horizontal gene transfer and pathogenic infection leads DNA expression change may also induce the TEI occurrence in animals and effect for several generations which both observes in mice and C.elegans (Moore et al., 2021; Tyebji et al., 2020). The variety of TEI mechanism would increase the potential differentiation between behavioral change of different animals as it may leads to the condition that same environmental stress but different mechanism taken would result different behavioral change in animals, and another possible condition would be more than one mechanism involve in the same TEI which result a behavioral alteration, for example the case of DDT effect in mice which single TEI effect involves the mechanism of histone modification, DNA methylation and small RNA differential expression (Skinner et al., 2018). Hence, the variety of TEI mechanism would also increase the difficulty when conduction the experiment.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Except for the variety of mechanism of TEI, the environmental stress that induced the TEI in different animals also various from one to another, which heat stress, food supply stress, olfactory imprinting would all lead to the TEI in animals (Zhang & Tian, 2021). In this literature review article, however, the focus would mainly shift on the effect of nutritional-related environmental stress on mammals and the mechanism of TEI took when facing this kind of environmental stress. For the nutritional-related environmental stress, the most common types are the starvation and high fat diet environmental stress because those two are most applicable in experiment condition (Crisóstomo et al., 2021; Zhang & Tian, 2021). For each different nutritional-related environmental stress, different results of experiment would be compared, which tries to find some specific pattern in the alteration of mechanism and resulted behavioral change. Also, the mechanism of each kinds of TEI pathway would also be explained in the review article in order to achieve a more holistic understanding about TEI in mammal. The reason for this review article to choose mammals as the discussion subject is the current condition in this research field. As the recent studies range from different kinds of animals but fewer studies are focusing on the mammal TEI effect due to the potential difficulty in conducting animal experiments and the complexity of mammal’s gene regulation mechanism that may leads to less obvious effect of TEI on their behavioral change. Thus, this condition leads to more and more research focus on C. elegans and plant species instead of focusing on mammals like mice which have a closer relationship with human. Thus, another target of this review article is to provide a basic view about the research of mammal TEI effect which would probably lower the threshold require to entering this research field and make it easier for researchers to do experiment on mammals. Overall, this review article would provide readers a basic view of the mammal TEI effect and their related behavioral change which also including the perspective on the mammal research TEI effect and the potential solution for the problems that may encounter when doing experiment on mammals.</p>

                                    <p>Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) is an interactive and dynamic field in mammals where environmental stress agents exert multi-generational effects through heritable epigenetic changes. As reviewed here, these effects are transmitted not by DNA sequence changes, but by changes in regulatory systems governing expression of genes, most prominently through such mechanisms as DNA methylation, histone modification, and differential expression of small RNAs. The concurrence among studies suggests that maternal and paternal nutrition—facing everything from caloric restriction to high fat diet—elicits epigenetic changes that have an effect on offspring phenotype, metabolism, and behavioral traits. The findings not only illustrate heterogeneity in biological reaction to environmental signals, but also heterogeneity in mechanisms governing epigenetic control that are species- and sex-specific and developmentally contingent.</p>

                                <p>Overall, the mammal transgenic inheritance on the effect of nutritional related environmental stress is still lack proper investigation and require for more improvement and funding for the future research. For the future investigation, more focused on other environmental stress is also required with water stress and social pressure also play significant role in effecting animal and their offspring’s behavior in the future. Even though the difficulty of using animal experience is still exist, it can be overcome in the future which more research experience is required for researchers is also required to design a proper experiment that can lead to ideal result that boost other research area. This area with great potential of future studying is hence essential for more focused by other researchers and people around the world, so as the author,  I hope this dissertation will be helpful for the researchers who just stepped into this research area and focus more on various kinds of research topics that can enrich researchers' knowledge and generate more valuable and practical result. To conclude, as the potential in this large research area is not fully explored, it is more and more essential for people to focus on this area of research and converting the result of research into practical usage like aided in precision medicine and also as a potential explanation for animal and human behavior. Not confined to genetic, the large scale transgenerational epigenetic inheritance effect may pose potential impact on the human evolution history that directly alter human's transmission scheme and result decrease in genetic variety in some extent.</p>
