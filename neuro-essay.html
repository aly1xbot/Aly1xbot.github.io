                                <p><b>Abstract:</b>Neurostimulation is a concept that getting more and more popular in disease therapy that typically focus on the patient that they can’t be cured by singly adopted medicine. Responsive Neurostimulation System hence be selected as a potential way to cure drug-resistant epilepsy that cause large harm to the patient themselves which the most typical example would be the H.M. Therefore, in responds to wider demand of this technology, the commercialize process is now putting on the agenda. But this process is now facing some ethical concern from consumer, and also endure stricter test by different research .This essay will mainly discuss the achievement of Responsive Neurostimulation system on the Epilepsy treatment, the difference between it and other brain stimulation, the ethical consideration of data in treatment, and the implication to the whole society of this new emerging technology which include the possible regulation taken by government to regulate the potential threat may face.  </p>

                                <p><b>Introduction:</b> Recently, neurotechnology related to neurostimulation like Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), and Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS)are becoming more and more popular in hospitals to treat neuro-diseases like Parkinson's. Except for these already close-to-mature technologies, a newly emerging technology called the Responsive Neurostimulation System (RNS) which was only approved by the FDA in 2013 for a small range of medical treatments is now getting more attention in treating drug-resistant epilepsy with approximately 17 million people worldwide suffer from this disease that responds less to the Anti-seizure medicine (ASMs) [1,2]. However, due to relatively later approval by the FDA compared to DBS, it turns out to be less commercialized and leads to more unpredicts in the future.</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>The basic mechanism of responsive neurostimulation system (RNS) treatment is implanting a device into the skull which contains two electrodes placed at epilepsy foci to pass electrical stimulation when epilepsy occurs and operated in an automotive manner [3]. Except for treating Epilepsy, the researcher could also set the RNS to detect abnormal electrographic events and send data to the server to be analysed, this action benefits researchers in testing the newly developed ASMs for their efficiency [4].</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>A double-blinded experiment conducted by a research team on drug-resistant epilepsy using RNS demonstrates its efficiency. During the whole period of treatment, the groups using RNS had a seizure reduction of 37.9% and the sham group only reduced by 17.9% [5]. In another experiment, except for the seizure reduction, researchers also identified 23.5% of patients demonstrated reliable change indices (RCI) increase and increased performance in Boston Naming Test (BNT) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (AVLT) test after receiving short bursts (100-200 msec) of high-frequency stimulation [6]. These results indicate to the consumer that RNS was suitable to treat epilepsy that is bilateral. But the relative experiment data suggest that RNS doesn't simply detect and stop seizures, it makes the seizure less likely to start by modulating the neural networks. Further study is needed to be done to find out the best position for intracranial node placement [7]. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The flaws and side effects should be considered by the developer as the experiment reported that the frequency of stimulation between two patients got different over 10 times which suggests that the developer should consider the heterogeneity of the events' threshold that led to the monitor-detected and the probability that false positive stimulation detection [8]. Except for this flaw, some clinical experiments have reported that implantation leads to side effects like infection, nausea, dizziness, rash, and osteomyelitis in different groups of patients [9, 10]. These side effects present the immaturity of RNS treatment and raise the question of whether siRNA is mature enough to enter the public market and be put into mass usage as a common treatment method. </p>

                                    <p><b>Different approach to Epilepsy Treatment: RNS vs. DBS & VNS: </b>Except for RNS treatment, there were other brain stimulation techniques like DBS and VNS which use the same mechanism but stimulate other areas of the brain to treat epilepsy. Both DBS and VNS were approved by the FDA much sooner (both in 1997) compared to RNS which represents they are relatively mature technologies and they all have correspondence treatment devices available on the market [2]. DBS could pass electrical stimulation on the anterior nucleus of the thalamus to lower the risk of worsening seizures by using low-frequency stimulation bilaterally which was proven by the experiment. VNS uses stimulation frequency at 30Hz for 30 seconds stimulation at the Vagus nerve system to decrease the happen of epilepsy [4]. Although the DBS and VNS experimental subjects were found to be well-tolerated, they exhibited a high occurrence rate of side-effects compared to the RNS experimental subjects. For VNS treatment, the most prevalent adverse effects included voice alteration or hoarseness (66%) and excessive coughing (45%) [4]. In the case of DBS experiments, depression (14.8% in the treatment group versus 1.8% in the control group) and memory impairment (13% in the active treatment group versus 1.8% in controls) were the most frequent adverse events [5]. For the RNS group, it would only be 1.2% with implanted site infection which is much lower compared to DBS and VNS [10].</p>
                                </div>
                                <p><b>Ethical consideration related to RNS treatment: </b>The process of commercializing RNS faces an ethical dilemma as well. The advanced function of RNS that it can treat epilepsy by passing current through certain areas in the brain, and can also monitor brain activity to detect the occurrence of epilepsy [11]. But these functions make consumers feel unsafe. As revealed by research, the consumer was concerned about whether RNS could monitor their brain and access what they are thinking in some form, even some scientists have proved that this was not capable for the current technology. They also worried about the privacy of their treatment data and concerned about the device's capabilities and whether this technology is mature enough to serve as another option for the surgical removal method [12]. Even though the questions were present, the commercialized process of RNS is unstoppable as the demand and the potential market are wide. Therefore, the question is, during the treatment, could consumers have the right to choose the treatment they want or apply this arguable technology directly when epilepsy happens? Also, should this technology be proposed as soon as it is mature since it could harm the pharmaceutical industry as people may choose this automatic treatment even if their epilepsy is not drug-resistant? These issues surrounding social science, health policy, consumer discretion, benefit games, and personal privacy would all be considered by the government and firms and make corresponding treatment towards these potential problems. As the RNS device is getting close and close to the wide public market, debates like this will always be preserved and it requires effort from many sides including the government, legislative system, and firms to regulate RNS device usage.</p>
