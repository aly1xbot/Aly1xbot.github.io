                                <p><b>Abstract:</b> Ranging around the world, Maize serves as an essential crops that perform an important role in food manufacturing, bio-fuel production, and also animal feed production. Especially in China, maize production takes place from south to north, scattering across the country and serving as an important food source for millions of people. In this research project, the researcher mainly focuses on the factors that will increase or decrease maize production and the potential environmental harms due to the agricultural process based on the other research results. Also, based on the merging technology in agriculture production and biological-related science, the author proposed a new method of crop planting or relevant processes to increase food yielding and also perform higher resistance to climate change and potential environmental stress. In the end, the possible effect on the environment of the new method will be discussed and the sustainability of the methods will also be considered. At the end of this report, the future direction of research will also be mentioned, and hoping to offer some assistance for future researchers to figure out new methods to improve crop production further. </p>

                                <p> <b>1. Introduction:</b> Globally, maize functions as an important food product, bio-energy fuel source, and also tillage for domesticated animals[1]. For the USA specifically, 42.9% of maize produced is used to feed poultry which also uses maize to background the cattle, and 41.8% of the maize is used for fuel ethanol production[2]. Around the world, the increasing trends of maize production from 1987 to 2015 demonstrate due to the increased percentage of high-yielding environments, the maize planting area hence reached as much as 197 M ha across multiple continents to face the increasing demand for maize production around the globe[1,3]. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>For China, the trend of growth in the productivity of maize are not reversible. The potential for future maize production increase in China which was measured by the APSIM method in 2012 is presented as large. Especially in the southeastern part of China, there is still a large gap between the maize yield and the potential maize production quantity[4]. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>This article aims to examine the various factors influencing maize production in China and globally, with a specific focus on associated environmental impacts. It also proposes innovative strategies to enhance maize productivity, evaluates their environmental consequences, and discusses their feasibility amid climate change. Future research directions are then outlined.</p>

                                <p><b>2.1. Factors Increase the Maize Production</b> The production of maize is influenced by many different factors, from the environment, economic factors to the technology and planting method. Each factors has a different extent of effect. One of the most important factors that causes the maize production increase is the climatic factor. In one study, the researchers demonstrate that there is a nonlinear relationship between maize production and the latitude of the maize-producing location, with production increasing as latitude increases[5]. This is due to latitude increase causing photoperiod increase in pre silking stage, leading to more sugar produced and stored which results in the increased production of spring maize[6].Further from the environmental factor, the farmer's agriculture method plays a key role in influencing the final productivity of the maize. For the fertilizer attribution, a U-shaped relationship has been demonstrated by researchers. The team indicates that there is a most technical efficiency point of nitrogen fertilization usage, that is 2547 yuan/hectare of fertilization cost in China[7].Lastly, social-related factors also influence maize production. Limited by their culture and education, some Chinese farmers will incorrectly use not optimal amount of fertilizer or storage facilities causing unnecessary crops lost[8,9]. Therefore, education of the farmer and appropriate scientific propaganda will enable farmers to plant the crops more efficiently and rationally and increase the maize yield. </p>

                                    <p>Agriculture is also responsible for a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, helping to drive climate change, rising carbon dioxide levels and a warming world. Changing rainfall patterns mean that some areas now receive too much water and others not enough. These factors are reducing food crop yields, not only of key crops like maize, wheat and rice but all plants, including chocolate, coffee and sugar. Advanced crop genetic engineering and new seed development are helping keep things growing for the moment, but as climate change advances and the human population continues to grow, new ways of intensively producing food need to be developed </p>

                                    <p><b>2.2 Problems Decrease the Maize Production:</b> The one that causes a significant reduction in maize production will be the onset of a variety of diseases that cause large production reductions. Spreading among different locations, like Curvularia leaf spots and Gray Leaf Spots, the disease sometimes causes a more widespread effect on maize production compared to climatic or technological factors [10,11]. Especially in China, researchers reported that the pathogen Bipolaris spp. can cause leaf sport and seed blight which already outbursts in the Sichuan area [12]. Not only environmental factors, but other social factors also influence maize production. Some researchers have found that due to education level constraints, many farmers in China do not recognize the importance of chemical fertilizers and won't calculate the production cost wisely [4]. At the same time, the geographic characteristics in China cause difficulty in spreading the technology as the land fragmentation restricts large-scale maize production and hence lowers the overall technical efficiency [4,13]. </p>

                                <p><b>2.3 Environemntal Problems Caused by the Maize Production:</b> During the maize agricultural process, several kinds of environmental problems may also take place. The most general kind of environmental problem will be water eutrophication due to the overdose of nitrogen or phosphorous fertilizer. As China accounts for 32% of nitrogen fertilizer consumed around the world with a rate of nitrogen discharge to freshwater at 14.5 + 3.1 Tg N yr-1, the eutrophication will significantly affect the local environment around the coastal region across China [14]. Not only for the eutrophication problems, the waste directly produced from the production process is also important to consider. Farmers will burn the maize stems after collecting the bushels because these stems can act as a great source of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer for the next round of crop production but emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide [15]. In one research, the researchers demonstrate that carbon emission per unit area in Norther China of monocropped maize is 19380.67 kg CO2-eq/ha, especially as China accounts for 12% of the world's agriculture carbon emission [16]. Damaging to the soil during maize planting is also significant. Researchers show that intensive usage of fertilizer and farming on lands will cause decrease in soil quality and further potential for agricultural production [17]. Also, for the physical side, the researchers in England observed intensive soil erosion after summer rainstorms which occurs at the time the soil after maize planting is directly exposed [18]. Lastly, as a typical agriculture process, maize production will also lead to significant water usage. As agriculture accounts for 70% of the world's freshwater consumption, maize production also takes a large percentage of China's freshwater usage, a 137.98 m3 of water scarcity with each tone of maize production is observed [19]. </p>

                                <p><b>2.4.1 Method 1: Genetic Engineering Maize Crops to Account for Different Environemntal Stress:</b> This method proposed will directly alter the properties of maize may increase the production of maize under different environmental stresses and also alter the nutrients within that enable the crops to have higher nutrient contents. This method is verified by many groups of researchers, in one study of the effectiveness of biotech-related genetic engineering on maize, the researchers demonstrated that altering expression or content across various loci will lead to changing output of maize in response to different conditions for different extents [20]. For example, the researchers found leads called AT-DTP6 and AT-CXE20 carboxylesterase leads will enable crops to have higher drought tolerance compared to normal strains [20]. Furthermore, other gene loci that have not been assessed also present potential locations for future alteration, like the transposal element like ZmCCT sequence can promote maize’s photoperiod sensitivity that enables the domestic spread of maize [21]. For the modification of the DNA expression, the method will be m6A RNA modification to alter the DNA methylation in the maize gene kernel. The mechanism of this method is based on the research that manifests that m6A and 5-methylcytosine can alter the DNA expression scheme through the crosstalk between m6A and 5-methylcytosine via the interaction between mRNA adenosine methylase [22]. Then, the increase in DNA methylation will cause the transposable element to change similar to the response towards the abiotic stress in which the DNA methylation increase causes the transposable element to change expression to be more tolerant to drought and more stable [23]. For the m6A modification, to achieve this effect, the target protein METLL3 is chosen, and a Ti plasmid insertion process by agrobacterium will be carried out, inserting a lac operon promoter sequence before the protein synthesis sequence [24]. The plasmid design will be based on the diagram below with the design sequence of METLL3 replacing the virulence region using a restriction enzyme. With more METLL3 being expressed in the maize gene, the DNA methylation will also be increased. The self-production of lactose in maize will promote the synthesizing of METLL3 protein in the maize and catalyze gene methylation. According to Y. Huang et al, starch production is deeply influenced by the miRNA which has a deep relationship with the DNA methylation method [25]. For example, the MiR167c and miR169o are identified to regulate the starch synthesized-related TFs and expression enriched in the region with low methylation levels [25]. The inserting plasmid will recombinant with the original DNA sequence using the recognizing and guiding sequence on the plasmid and performing DNA insertion. </p>

                                <p><b>2.4.2 Method 2: Artificial Intelligence and Advaced Facilities Manipulating Maize Growth</b> The second proposed method is based on the modification to the current planting method. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence, its strong computational force enables farmers to handle large data with the aid of advanced facilities. In many research articles, researchers point out the importance of manipulating the maize planting precisely will increase the overall production and also lower the cost of input. For example, in one research, researchers focus on the relationship between planting density and quantity of fertilization applied to planting [26]. The increase in planting density and decrease in nitrogen fertilizer use will increase the yield of maize and reduce eutrophication at the same time which is mainly due to the nitrogen fertilizer [26]. According to Fernandes et al. and Dilmurat et al., machine learning can help predict the yielding of maize by combining the genetic data with environmental data and also the hyperspectral and lidar data fusion through the unmanned aerial vehicle [27,28]. To set up the field, the planting method should be modified according to the results from Djaman et al., Tiammee et al., Du et al. and Assefa et al. which has a planting density of 87,750 plants ha-1 and nitrogen fertilizer implemented 204 kg N ha-1 that demonstrating increase 24.7% of N partial factor productivity and 6.6% of grain yield and the planting date will close to May 18 with the density close to 88,000 pph Using these criteria, it is reported that this will reach the maximum production efficiency and also the highest water usage efficiency to ensure the sustainability of maize production from the environmental aspect[29]. At the same time, the government can fund the farmers for the installment of soil moisture sensors, soil acidity sensors, atmospheric CO2 sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for multiple sensing processes involved in the later cultivating process. Starting from this setup, the future planting process will be closely monitored by the various devices combined with Artificial Intelligence. From the aerial side, the UAV used will be responsible for performing hyperspectral imaging on the nitrogen deficiency aided by machine learning and transfer modeling, and the monitor will be performed at least once per month [30]. This protocol will detect the occurrence of nitrogen deficiency by monitoring the canopy nitrogen level and chlorophyll level[30]. At the same time, a model called maize-YOLO, which is based on the YOLOv7 model with the insertion of the CSPResNeXt-50 module and VoVGSCSP module that guarantees the accuracy, will be used to perform real-time monitoring of maize pest outburst[31]. Further soothing the damage from pests, push-pull agriculture may be introduced to both northern and southern Chinese farmers by using a small land and water input to a source that is more attractive to pests which distracts the pests from the more valuable crop plants [32]. Even more, farmers can both use machine learning to analyze the genetic and environmental data to ensure the precision of production prediction or use other artificial intelligence for modeling the potential maize yield that is similar to the method implemented in East Africa [27,33]. </p>

                                <p><b>2.5 Solution for Climate Change:</b>In the first method, it can directly cope with the environmental stress caused by changing climate by modifying the genetic expression to make it more reluctant to certain stress. In this method, we use heat stress as an example, that changing methylation extent can cope with the increased temperature that spread in southern China. Therefore, for this first method, scientists can modify the gene expression in maize to respond to various temperature stresses in different locations, further facilitate the spread of maize across the country, and also increase the area of agricultural land as maize adapts to extreme conditions. The second method can cope with climate change by regulating the amount of input under the guidance of precision farming. For example, the increase in climate will cause a drop in water level in the soil which triggers the sensor to warn the farmers to increase irrigation frequency that protects the plants. The changing climate may rather increase or decrease the maize nitrogen requirement it will be easy to monitor the change using the UAV aerial-based observance [28]. </p>

                                <p><b>2.6 Environmental Problems Generated:</b>Even for both of these new methods, some environmental problems for maize planting still cannot be avoided. For example, soil erosion when bare soil is exposed to summer storming is hard to prevent [18]. However, except for the common environmental problems generated, each method produces unique pollution and poses harm to the biodiversity of environmental conditions. Due to the genetic engineering in the first method, the potential of spreading the hybrid gene to the wild maize type through random fertilization may cause gene pollution in the wild population, posing a threat to future maize-related hybrid studies. On the other side, the precision agricultural method still poses environmental harm by generating lots of chemical pollutants from the waste of electrical devices with high toxicity and also high electrical energy usage requirements.</p>

                                <p><b>2.7 Methods Sustainability Assay</b>In the first method, genetic engineering can make the plants become more water stress tolerant, which hence will decrease the water usage in the drought period but also in normal conditions. In addition, the genetic engineer can alter the nutrition content within the maize, achieving a higher nutrient productivity per acre, by making the starch content in the maize more degradable by the human body and hence easier to absorb[34]. In the second method, the most noteworthy contribution to environmental sustainability is the reduction of nitrogen-related pollution, especially eutrophication. Because it is easy for nitrate ions to be removed from the soil through runoff as it is only attached weakly to the negative charge soil particles. Thus, large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer in China will cause severe eutrophication in the coastal area and also in the river[14]. But using this new method, only limited nitrogen fertilizer will be employed by farmers and hence significantly decrease the eutrophication condition and lead to more environmentally friendly agricultural production. </p>

                                <p><b>3.1 Potnetial Limitation:</b>One drawback that is common for both methods is requiring relatively high money investment to achieve the effect that sufficiently increases the maize yield. The gene engineering method needs lots of repeated experiments and assays to satisfy the national food standard that can safely be used as agricultural plants and precision agriculture require large government funding. For the limitations that are specific to the first genetic engineering method, it will be less flexible when facing environmental change. For example, if a genetically modified maize species that is well adapted to hot temperatures suddenly faces a large decrease in temperature to a very cold level, it may cause further harm to the production as some mechanisms may be more adapted to hot temperatures.  For the second method, the intensive employed of advanced facilities not only puts pressure on the government budget but also adds complexity to agriculture for farmers. Some facilities require professional knowledge to interpret the data. Therefore, the spread of this method still facing lots of pressure.</p>
